\section{Synopsis}

Synergy needs rewriting from scratch in order to provide a long term fix for 
bugs such as the ``sticky keys'' issue. It is difficult to fix bugs in the
current version of Synergy without causing regressions. With this rewrite, we
will use a specific methodology in order to make the software more robust.

\section{License}

We will use a license that allows companies to include Synergy as part of an 
existing product, but not on it's own (if there is such a license). This might
be the New BSD License (or GPLv3 if it allows commercial redistribution).
