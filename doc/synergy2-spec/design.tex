\section{Design}

\subsection{Scope}

With a tool as conceptually simple as Synergy, it's very easy to get carried
away with feature requests. Some features we will \textbf{not include}:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Dragging windows between screens.
  \item Remote audio sharing.
  \item Connecting over the Internet.
  \item Smart phone or tablet as server.
  \item Remote desktop integration.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{GUI}

While version 1 is simple to setup, it can be a little difficult to
troubleshoot. As command-line tools go, the existing version is great, but
can be a little involved for some users. Often these users are from a Windows
or Mac background where tool configuration is usually done with a GUI.

Version 1 was originally designed as a command line tool, then later on, several
GUI applications were invented to try and make configuration easier. QSynergy is
one of those GUIs that found a good balance of cross-platform support and user 
friendliness. However, like all Synergy GUIs, it is limited by the lack of 
interoperability with the underlying command line utility. So we should design 
version 2 with inter-process communication (IPC) to the GUI firmly in mind. 
Security is also an issue; we need to make sure a malicious program can't
connect to Synergy via the IPC layer (perhaps a shared key will be sufficient).

With this version, we aim to make configuration extremely simple so that anyone
can use Synergy without having to know anything about IPs or which machine is a
server or a client. One setup option will be that the user can use a wizard (see
Figure \ref{fig:setupWizard}). The wizard should include an ``online'' manual 
with a troubleshooting section. Troubleshooting steps might include asking the 
user to temporarily turn off their firewall, try pinging, etc. This will reduce
the number of troubleshooting requests coming into the website and mailing list.
The user will can always drag and drop screens into the designer (instead of
using the edge-hit feature) just in case the edge-hit feature fails to work
correctly.

When starting the wizard, the user will choose between two options: Simple (a
guided process, which is very easy to use, and creates a P2P network); and
Advanced, which allows the user to load a config file -- this makes it possible
to setup a sever-client configuration, or lead a version 1 config.

  \label{fig:setupWizard}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Place screens anywhere}

While the version 1 configuration syntax does allow for screens to be placed at
positions relative to each other, most (if not all) GUIs so far have not 
considered this. In version 2 we will allow the user to drag screens anywhere
(on the layout designer) so that you can have (for example) two small screens
stacked next to a large screen.

\subsection{Run at startup}

With version 1, most users need to have some technical knowledge of their OS
in order to start synergy when their computer boots. This new version must
take care of starting at boot automatically in order to be more seamless.

Autostart on Linux is exceptionally difficult because different versions Linux 
require different configurations. In particular auto starting after the X server
starts requires editing shell scripts. Maybe we can start via init.d and poll 
for a running X server.

\subsection{Keyboard}

In version 1, key chars are sent over the network. This poses a nightmare when
it comes to multilingual support, or even just supporting new keys (e.g. media
keys, etc). It's easy to read key chars, and it's tempting to re-use this 
approach in version 2; however, it will only give us problems and bugs to fix,
when what we really need to do is support key codes.

What's so good about key codes? Instead of relaying the char that the user would
see typed in any other application, we relay the code of the key that is 
pressed, which is not be tied to any particular language. This means that a user
can type in English on computer A, and Russian on computer B without needing to
switch the language on the master. Instead, the user chooses the language on
the receiver.

There is a complication with key codes however; each operating system has its
own set of key codes - so we need to map each key code to our own set, so that
key codes sent over the network are generic and can be translated to any 
platform.

\subsection{Network model}

We will support both server-client (traditional) and a new P2P model, as
described in this section.

\subsubsection{Server-client}

Historically, Synergy has always used a server-client model, where the server's
mouse and keyboard control the clients (figure \ref{fig:serverClient}). This is
actually the opposite to how remote access applications work, where the computer
being controlled is the server (not a client). We will use the same port as 
version 1 (24800), though the protocols will not be compatible.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \input diag/nd-serverclient.tex
  \caption{Server-client network model}
  \label{fig:serverClient}
\end{figure}

The computer with the mouse and keyboard must be online at all other times to
make the other computers useful (laptops excluded). To some degree, it makes 
sense to have this computer as the server, since the server should be online
at all times.

The disadvantage is that when the server computer goes offline, all other 
computers become somewhat redundant (until you physically plug a keyboard
and mouse into each of them). One solution is to allow any computer to be a 
master (to have control over the other computers)...

\subsubsection{Peer-to-peer (P2P)}

% this section is heavily based on this mailing list thread:
%   http://groups.google.com/group/synergy-plus-dev/browse_thread/thread/5a09353d55fc1364

Allowing any computer to be a master implies that any computer can control
any other computer. So you could have two computers with a mouse (e.g. a 
desktop and a laptop) and two without. Figure \ref{fig:p2p} shows 3 networks;
each show 3 nodes listening for TCP connections, and one (the hub) making the
outgoing connections. This figure also illustrates that any node can be either
a master, or a hub, or both (the terms ``hub'' and ``master'' are not to be 
confused with each other).

Given that
all nodes could potentially be listening; each node must always adjust it's
firewall setup to accept traffic on the 24800 port. Though this port is the
same one as is used by both version 1, and version 2 server-client, it will
not work with either of these.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \input diag/nd-p2p.tex
  \caption{P2P ``hub'' network model}
  \label{fig:p2p}
\end{figure}

Why might this be useful? Let's say you've just arrived at the
office, with your laptop resumed from sleep - you sit down just in time to see
a 30 second restart countdown on your ``mouseless'' computer. Uh-oh, looks like
that new sys admin has decided to restart your workstation, great! No problem, 
just fire up your Synergy server machine, move the mouse over and hit the 
``Abort'' button - but oh no, your server machine is running Windows and has 
decided to blue screen today. Your 2nd computer restarts and you've lost an 
entire night's work because you forgot to hit save at 3am. Ok, so it's a bit 
of an edge-case but you get the picture; some times it's a chore to turn your
server on in order to use your other computers.

We might be tempted to have each node connect to every other node, but
unfortunately this doesn't scale too well; it's always better to have less
connections if it can be helped. The hub topology is well suited for this,
since it will make the smallest number of connections.

This topology will work well on DHCP networks where
each computer could potentially have a new IP each time it reconnects (though
the rate at which IPs change is quite slow/predictable). Even so, this also 
means that the user need not have a valid DNS setup (which is a fairly common
problem). Many first-time users attempt to use only the hostname (which actually
resolves to nothing at all), then complain when they cannot connect. The answer
is always ``Use IP addresses instead,'' which needless to say, is very tiring.

\subsubsection{The master mode}

So when does a node switch to master mode? One option might be to make this
automatic and triggered by mouse movement. The problem with this sort of
detection is that it's not always possible (depending on the platform) to
detect real (by a human) or ``fake'' (by Synergy) input. It might be the
case that some OSs can distinguish between real and fake input, but we cannot
always guarantee this to be the case. So, we should make master/slave switching
manual at the user's discretion. For example, if the user wishes for their
laptop to become the master, they can just use their laptop touch pad to
select master from their system tray icon (or command line, etc). It is
important that the user can do this while Synergy is running; having to restart
the program may make things complicated for the user. We may decide to 
introduce an automatic master mode at some point in the future, but this is
certainly not essential for the meantime.

\subsubsection{Introducing new nodes}

Each time a new node joins the configuration, the hub node will connect to 
it. If the node announces but does not get any incoming connections from an
existing hub node, then it will assume the hub role. A non-hub will always send
messages through the hub node (which is a TCP client), since all other nodes 
are always connected via the hub. All nodes will attempt to configure 
themselves automatically without requiring any intervention from the user. This
does require some degree of guesswork; we will need to make the program 
``smart'' enough to figure out which node to use as the hub, and so on. This of
course introduces a very large margin for error. So as a backup, we should 
allow the user to manually force a particular node to be the hub, in case the
automatic configuration does not work correctly.

If a non-hub node looses connection with the hub, it will send an announce (just
like it did when it first came online). This may have happened for one of two
reasons: either the hub has gone offline; or the connection between the node
and the hub has been interrupted (maybe the node's firewall was reconfigured).
For the former case (hub went offline), all nodes will be affected by this, so
eventually one of them will announce (just like when it first came online).
Since none of the nodes are hubs, none can respond, therefore the first node
to disconnect becomes the new hub, and will respond to further announces.
For the latter case (connection interrupted), the node will still announce,
but it's likely that even if the hub is online, it probably can't communicate
with the non-hub node. In this case, the orphaned node will make a special
kind of announcement, to say ``I'm the new hub!'' -- in this case, all other
nodes (both hub and non-hub) will drop their connections and announce. The
new hub will then pick up all other nodes. If none respond, then we can assume
that either there is a serious network error, or there genuinely are no more
nodes. In the event that two nodes attempt to become the hub at nearly the same
time, there will always be one that does so a little later than the other; in
this case, the latest node will become the hub (we may want to introduce a time
delay based on node ID to prevent this from happening).

The hub node will be aware of all other non-hub nodes by IP address, and will
associate each one with a sequential 16-bit node ID. The non-hub nodes themselves
do not need to know the IP addresses of other non-hub nodes, since the hub node
will route messages based on node ID. The full set of node IDs are maintained
on every node, and are pushed out from the hub each time a new node leaves or
joins.

\subsubsection{Security concerns}

Allowing any Synergy node to say ``Hey, I'm here, connect to me!'' introduces
a security dilemma. A malicious program could easily broadcast using Bonjour
pretending to be a real Synergy client. We should do two things to help prevent
this: first, have a configurable option to turn remote control on or off for
a particular node (we might turn this off by default, and allow users to turn
it on during configuration); secondly, messages can be encrypted (on by 
default).

If a node loses contact with its peer, it will attempt to automatically fix
the problem in one of two ways (depending on whether the incoming or outgoing 
connection was lost). If the outgoing connection was dropped (i.e. the 
connection that the node has initiated) then it will attempt to connect each 
of the other known nodes in round-robin fashion until it finds a new peer. It 
will keep trying forever, or until the incoming connection drops (if this 
happens then we can assume that the IP-to-node mapping may be stale). If
the incoming connection drops, then the node will re-announce (and will keep
doing so forever), hoping that another Synergy node will eventually connect.

\subsubsection{Legacy support}

The disadvantage of P2P is that some users may have their server on one network
(behind a firewall) and a client on a restricted network (e.g. corporate wifi).
For this reason, we must still support client-server for such users who are 
less fortunate. Another reason to still support client-server is that users may
want to upgrade straight from version 1 to version 2 and use the same config 
file.

\subsection{Protocol}

Each key press and mouse delta will trigger a message sent over a simple TCP 
stream (see Table \ref{tab:messageFormat}).

\begin{table}[ht!]
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Pos} &
    \textbf{Part} &
    \textbf{Size} &
    \textbf{Type} &
    \textbf{Comment} \\
    \hline
    0 & Size & 2B & uint16\_t & Total message size in bytes (inc header). \\
    4 & Type & 2B & uint16\_t & Bitmask (see Table \ref{tab:messageTypes}) \\
    8 & To ID & 2B & uint16\_t & Runtime generated recipient node ID. \\
    6 & From ID & 2B & uint16\_t & Runtime generated sender node ID. \\
    8 & Mux ID & 4B & uint32\_t & Runtime generated TCP mux ID (recycled). \\
    12 & Chunk ID & 2B & uint16\_t & Sequential ID of the TCP mux chunk. \\
    14 & Payload & $<$64KB & char[] & The chunk payload (binary data). \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{TCP message format}
  \label{tab:messageFormat}
\end{table}

Encryption will be supported, and will be enabled by default. Cryptography may 
put a noticeable load on the CPU, so we must allow this to be turned on and off
(but on by default). The message as defined in Table \ref{tab:messageFormat}
can be wrapped in an encrypted message, but will have no knowledge of encryption
itself.

% TODO: turn question into statement!
Security requires not just encryption but also authentication. We should choose
or suggest appropriate standards for these. Do we allow various encryption and
authentication schemes? If so we must define a handshake to negotiate them.

\begin{table}[ht!]
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Type} &
    \textbf{Data} &
    \textbf{Detail} \\
    \hline
    ServerClient & - & Use the server-client topology. \\
    PeerToPeer & - & Use the peer-to-peer (P2P) topology. \\
    HelloServer & Client key & Client message to server on connect. \\
    HelloClient & Access allowed? & Response to key authentication. \\
    KeyCodeDown & Key code & Generic HID\footnotemark key code (from 
    keyboard). \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Message type enumeration (incomplete)}
  \label{tab:messageTypes}
\end{table}

The Type bitmask must be compatible with a \textit{bitwise and} operation on
the values of either ServerClient or PeerToPeer (in other words, the bitmask
must include one of these flags) otherwise the message will be discarded.

\footnotetext{Human input device}

\subsubsection{TCP multiplexing}

Clipboard data must also be sent over the same connection as mouse and
keyboard input. This is fine if the user has copied a small amount of data
such as a block of text; but what about images? Big problem! If Synergy is busy
sending a picture of of fluffy kittens, then user input relaying will suffer.
We could open a new connection specifically for clipboard data, but this idea
doesn't scale too well and we would need to open more ports. That said, having
a separate connection, may work out as a cheap option should we need one.

The best-practice solution is to implement TCP multiplexing (mux), which will 
allow us to prioritize the messages that we send over a single connection. We
might achieve this by chunking messages and adding them to a prioritized queue,
where human input device (HID) messages are immediately sent to the front. The
receiver will then be responsible for re-constructing the chunks into real 
messages. However, we might want to be careful of chunking HID messages, since 
these need to be more performant (the speed of sending clipboard data doesn't 
really matter).

We could prioritize whole messages, but what if 4GB of clipboard data enters
the queue? The solution is to ``chunk'' the message payload so that high 
priority message chunks are sent in between low priority message chunks. Each TCP
message describes one chunk, the maximum size of the chunk is 64KB minus the 
header (approx 65522 bytes). There will be a slight performance hit for large
data, since each chunk has a 10 byte overhead, and the message needs to be 
serialized and deserialized. This is not really a problem though, because the
user will often favor the convenience of copy and pasting files, over the 
performance of a file sharing protocol.

Each TCP mux chunk has a sequential ID, which is unique to the mux message
(a collection of mux chunks). The maximum value of the sequential chunk ID is
$2^{16}-1$, and a chunk can be at most ~64KB, therefore the maximum mux message
size is approx 4GB. The Mux ID is a sequential number with a maximum value of 
$2^{32}-1$, meaning that we can have a maximum of $~4GB \times 2^{32}-1$ (
approx 16GB) of data in the TCP mux queue at any given time.

\subsection{Configuration}

In server-client mode, the configuration will live on the server, just like in
version 1. We will also entirely support version 1 configurations. In fact, 
version 2 configuration file will be almost identical, but with a few added
options (e.g. to state whether or not the setup is client-server or P2P). We 
will not make version 2 configurations backward-compatible.

In P2P mode however, things get complicated. Each node must be aware of its
neighbor in terms of physical screen location and network peering
(incidentally, there will be no correlation between the two, since network 
peering will be based on availability and network time proximity). So, in the
case of P2P, the configuration file will be shared. Since there can only be
one master active at a time, this machine is responsible for distributing
changes to the configuration file. Now that the configuration file is shared,
any machine can assume command of the ship, since it'll already know the layout
of the screens.

\subsubsection{Screen stacking}

Using version 1, if the user adds a node to a Synergy configuration which has
multiple operating systems install (sometimes known as dual-boot if there are
two operating systems), then they have a problem, since you cannot have two
screens directly adjacent to a particular screen (TODO: prove this!). A quick
fix for this would be to give the machine the same hostname or IP, but this
might not always be convenient for the user (depending on their network setup).

One solution is to allow users to add nodes to a stack, which can be placed
adjacent to another screen or stack. This way we can allow one of the screens
in a stack to be active at any given time.
