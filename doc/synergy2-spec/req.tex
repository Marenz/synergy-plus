\section*{License}

The user must comply with the New BSD license. We will use this particular 
license so that anyone (including corporations) can freely use and modify 
Synergy so long as they display the original copyright notice and disclaimer.

The license used in version 1 was GPLv2, and as such, stopped larger 
corporations from using the software because it required them to publish
their changes.
