    <p>{t}Having problems using Synergy? You're in the right place!{/t}</p>

    <h3>{t}Try the latest version{/t}</h3>
    <p>
  {t escape=no url="$baseUrl/download/"}Many bugs are raised even 
  though users haven't tried the latest version.
  Please visit the <a href="%1">downloads</a> page and try out the
  latest version (even if it's a beta). You might also want to try the
  <a href="/nightly/">nightly builds</a> as a last resort, but please do so
  only as a last resort (these versions have not passed our quality assurance).{/t}
    </p>

    <h3>{t}Do your research{/t}</h3>
    <p>
  {t escape=no url="$baseUrl/search/"}Before asking anyone for help,
  do a <a href="%1">quick search</a>,
  it really won't take long. You <strong>must</strong> fully
  research your problem before asking us for help. You can also
  <a href="/tracker/projects/synergy/wiki/Docs">read the docs</a>
  to find out how to use config files, etc.{/t}
    </p>

    <h3>{t}Ask your question{/t}</h3>
    <p>
  {t}If you're having trouble configuring or starting Synergy, please 
  ask a <strong>question</strong> on the 
  <a href="http://synergy-foss.org/osqa/">Synergy Q&#38;A site</a>.
  Read the <a href="/osqa/faq/">FAQ</a> to make sure your question does not get closed.{/t}
    </p>

    <h3>{t}Mailing list and IRC{/t}</h3>
    <p>
  {t}More traditional open source users may prefer to 
  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/synergy-plus/post">use the mailing list</a>
  (just click "Apply for group membership" -- everyone is allowed,
  this is just to protect us against spammers). Please do not post
  bugs on the mailing list. You can also join our IRC channel:
  <code>#synergy on irc.freenode.net:8001</code> (for IRC, you could
  use <a href="http://xchat.org/">XChat</a>) -- but
  the same applies for IRC; do your research first!{/t}
    </p>

    <h3>{t}Super User{/t}</h3>
    <p>
      {t}If you're familiar with Super User, there's a <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/tagged/synergy">synergy tag</a>.{/t}
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>{t}Super User is <b>not</b> dedicated to supporting Synergy.{/t}</li>
      <li>{t}Ask questions; do not nag or comment on bugs or issues.{/t}</li>
      <li>{t}Do not raise new bugs there; use the issue tracker for this.{/t}</li>
      <li>{t}Synergy developers do <i>not</i> monitor this website.{/t}</li>
      <li>{t}Always use the "synergy" tag on your question.{/t}</li>
      <li>{t}Make sure you mention "Synergy" in the question.{/t}</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>{t}Report a bug{/t}</h3>
    <p>
  {t}If you've exhausted all other options, and are using the latest version,
  then should raise a bug. To do this,
  <a href="/tracker/account/register">register</a> a new account
