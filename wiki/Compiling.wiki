#summary How to build synergy from the source

= Prerequisites =

To build synergy from the sources you'll need the following:

  * Windows
    * VC++ 6.0 or up 

  * Unix
    * gcc 2.95 or up
    * X11R4 or up headers and libraries 

  * Mac OS X
    * XCode; or gcc 2.95 or up
    * Carbon development headers and libraries 

= Configuring =

This step is not necessary when using VC++ or XCode.

To configure the build for your platform use the configure script:

  ./configure

For a list of options to configure use:

  ./configure --help

On Solaris you may need to use:

  ./configure --x-includes=/usr/openwin/include --x-libraries=/usr/openwin/lib

so synergy can find the X11 includes and libraries.


= Building =

  * Windows

      Start VC++ and open synergy.dsw. Set the active configuration (Build > Set Active Configuration) to All - Debug or All - Release then build. Binaries are built into ./debug or ./build.

  * Unix or Mac OS X without XCode
  To build the client and server and leave them in their respective source directories Simply enter:

    make

  * Mac OS X with XCode

    Start XCode and open the synergy.xcode project. Build the all project using the Deployment flavor.

= Installing =

  * Windows

    You'll need NSIS, the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System. Build All - Release then build Installer - Release. This creates SynergyInstaller.exe in the build directory. Run this to install synergy.

    Alternatively, you can simply copy the following files from the debug or build directory to a directory you choose (perhaps under the Program Files directory):
     synergy.exe
     synergyc.exe
     synergys.exe
     synrgyhk.dll 

  * Unix or Mac OS X without XCode

     make install
    
    will install the client and server into /usr/local/bin unless you specified a different directory when you ran configure.

  * Mac OS X with XCode

    Copy the following files from ./build to a convenient location:
     synergyc
     synergys
