#summary How to build Synergy+ from source on all platforms.

= Prerequisites =

To build synergy from the sources you'll need the following:

  * Windows
    * VC++ 6.0 and up 

  * Unix
    * automake
    * gcc 2.95 and up
    * X11R4 and up (headers and libraries)
    * libXtst-dev (on Ubuntu)

  * Mac OS X
    * automake
    * XCode; or gcc 2.95 and up
    * Carbon development headers and libraries 

= Configuring =

This step is not necessary when using VC++ or XCode.

Run these commands:

{{{
 autoreconf
 ./configure
}}}

For a list of options to configure use:

  ./configure --help

On Solaris you may need to use:

  ./configure --x-includes=/usr/openwin/include --x-libraries=/usr/openwin/lib

This allows Synergy+ to find the X11 includes and libraries.

On Arch Linux you may need to use:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr

= Building =

== Windows ==

Start VC++ and open synergy.dsw. Set the active configuration (Build > Set Active Configuration) to All - Debug or All - Release then build. Binaries are built into ./debug or ./build.

== Unix-based ==

Including:
  * Linux
  * Mac OS X (without XCode)

To build the client and server and leave them in their respective source directories Simply enter:

  make

== Mac OS X (with XCode) ==

Start XCode and open the synergy.xcode project. Build the all project using the Deployment flavor.

= Installing =

These install instructions apply to developers, and are meant as a continuation from the compile instructions above.

== Windows ==

You'll need NSIS, the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System. Build All - Release then build Installer - Release. This creates SynergyInstaller.exe in the build directory. Run this to install synergy.

Alternatively, you can simply copy the following files from the debug or build directory to a directory you choose (perhaps under the Program Files directory):

  * synergy.exe
  * synergyc.exe
  * synergys.exe
  * synrgyhk.dll 

== Unix-based ==

Including:
  * Linux
  * Mac OS X (without XCode)

As root:

  make install

Or, if non-root user:

  sudo make install
    
This will install the client and server into /usr/local/bin unless you specified a different directory when you ran configure.

== Mac OS X (with XCode) ==

Copy the following files from ./build to a convenient location:

  * synergyc
  * synergys
