= Release Process =

The following steps should be followed for releasing a new version.

  # Appoint the release manager (the person that ensures these steps are followed).
  # Create a new branch with the version number (e.g. release-1.3.4)
  # Inform the synergy-plus-dev mailing list that a new release branch is active, and point them to this page.
  # Decide what bug fixes and features go into this version by tagging them on the bug tracker.
  # *First*, implement the assigned bug fixes and features on the *trunk* then back-port them to the release branch (this is very important!).
  # Stabilize the release branch to a point that it is suitable for end users.
  # Move the release branch from to the `branches` directory to the `tags` directory (at this point, no further changes should be made).
  # Create the Windows installer, Mac OS X installer, Linux packages, Source tar.gz.
