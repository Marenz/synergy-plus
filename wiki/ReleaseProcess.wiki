The following steps should be followed for releasing a new version.

  # Create a new branch with the version number (e.g. version-1.3.4)
  # Inform mailing list that a new release branch is active, which acts as an informal invitation to work on the release branch (not everyone will want to).
  # Appoint a new branch owner, the person who drives the release of the branch and ensures that the appropriate steps are follows.
  # Decide what features go into this version by tagging them on the bug tracker.
  # Allow other developers to work on the main line (branch: default) unaffected by the release.
  # Stabilize the release branch to a point that it is suitable for end users (i.e. no features are left incomplete).
  # On the mailing list, declare that the release branch is no longer active.
  # Create the Windows installer, Mac OS X installer, Linux packages, Source tar.gz.
  # Merge the code changes introduced in the release branch back into the main line.
