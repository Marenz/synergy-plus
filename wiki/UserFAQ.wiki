= Questions =

== Q. How do I install the application? ==

Download and run the latest installer from the [http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/downloads/list downloads page]. Advanced users can follow our [Compiling compile instructions].

== Q. How do I configure the application? ==

Windows users can use the Synergy GUI application which is installed by default. Linux and Mac OS X users should take a look at [RelatedProjects], which suggests some 3rd party applications that can be used to configure Synergy+. Advanced users can follow our [Setup setup instructions].

== Q. How do I get help with problems? ==

If you're having problems, please either post a new message in our [http://groups.google.com/group/synergy-plus user mailing list], or if you think you've found a bug, please create a [http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/issues/entry new issue].

== Q. How do I send you guys debug output? ==

When reporting a bug or trying to solve a problem, it's always useful to attach debug output from `synergyc` or `synergys`. To do this, run the application from the command prompt and use the `--debug DEBUG1` argument (or `DEBUG2` for extra verbosity). On unix platform this will be sent to console, but on Windows you'll need to use the special console window (accessed via the system tray). Future versions support logging to file (not including v1.3.4), by using the `--log <file>` argument.

Once you've got the debug output in a text file, please attach this to the appropriate issue, or [http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/issues/entry create a new one] if necessary.
 
== Q. Why do I get "This application has failed to start..." error? ==

The installer does not currently include the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package. Please download either the [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf&displaylang=en x86] or [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=BD2A6171-E2D6-4230-B809-9A8D7548C1B6&displaylang=en x64] version.

== Q. How do I lock the mouse on one screen? ==

This is useful for when playing computer games or other full screen applications. The `Scroll Lock` key can be used to prevent the mouse switching input to another screen.

*Note:* For users that don't have a scroll lock key, Issue 61 has been created.

== Q. What's the difference between Synergy+ and a KVM? ==

The biggest difference is that a KVM handles video, and Synergy+ does not. To use our application, you must have a display for each computer. Other than that, Synergy+ is better because you don't need to press a button to change input focus (just move your mouse off the edge of your screen).

== Q. How secure is your application? ==

Well, not very, but we're working on it. One of our targets for milestone M2 is to make synergy run over an encrypted connection. You're safe to use Synergy+ if you're on a network you trust, such as a LAN which is protected from the internet using a firewall.
