== Q. How do I install the application? ==

Download and run the latest installer from the [http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/downloads/list downloads page]. Advanced users can follow our [Compiling compile instructions].

== Q. How do I configure the application? ==

Windows users can use the Synergy GUI application which is installed by default. Linux and Mac OS X users should take a look at [RelatedProjects], which suggests some 3rd party applications that can be used to configure Synergy+. Advanced users can follow our [Setup setup instructions].

== Q. How do I get help with problems? ==

If you're having problems, please either post a new message in our [http://groups.google.com/group/synergy-plus user mailing list], or if you think you've found a bug, please create a [http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/issues/entry new issue].

== Q. How do I lock the mouse on one screen? ==

This is useful for when playing computer games or other full screen applications. The `Scroll Lock` key can be used to prevent the mouse switching input to another screen.

*Note:* For users that don't have a scroll lock key, Issue 61 has been created.

== Q. What's the difference between Synergy+ and a KVM? ==

The biggest difference is that a KVM handles video, and Synergy+ does not. To use our application, you must have a display for each computer. Other than that, Synergy+ is better because you don't need to press a button to change input focus (just move your mouse off the edge of your screen).

== Q. How secure is your application? ==

Well, not very, but we're working on it. One of our targets for milestone M2 is to make synergy run over an encrypted connection. You're safe to use Synergy+ if you're on a network you trust, such as a LAN which is protected from the internet using a firewall.
