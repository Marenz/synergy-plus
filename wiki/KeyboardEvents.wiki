== Text level with fallback to virtual keys ==
 * current implementation
 * backward compatibility

== RAW ==
 * much better support for other keyboard layouts (no more i18n issues)
 * games support / fullscreen
 * should work in more cases (login screens, security popups)
 * less likely to have sticky modifiers
 * on Windows it is impossible to simulate a keyboard event that would produce a specific Unicode character if the current keyboard layouts is not able to produce it.
