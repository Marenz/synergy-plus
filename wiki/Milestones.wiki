#summary Project milestones such as M1, M2, M3, Mx

These milestones have been created to serve as targets for significant releases. These will ensure that we have solid targets, which means better performance.

== Milestone M1 ==

Due to new operating systems, the original Synergy is no longer fully compatible. In Vista, due to session isolation, Synergy can't be used at the login screen or when run as a service (issue 26). On Mac OS X, neither the client or server can be run in daemon mode (issue 46), and clipboard sharing has stopped working (issue 67).

For milestone M1, we're going to get Synergy+ back to a fully supporting standard, but we're not going to worry about new features. There are also some more involved bugs, that, if we were to assign to M1 would delay it substantially - these bugs are left to M2.

== Milestone M2 ==

International keyboard support is quite bad at the moment (issue 5), this may be because the original Synergy was designed with only en-us keyboards in mind. For example, for some en-gb keyboards, the @ symbol does not appear when pressed (instead the omega Ω symbol appears). There are also issues with other non-us characters such as č, which appears as just c. This requires an overhaul of the key press detection system Because this is such an epic task, we have deferred this to M2, even though it is still a bug.

Security enhancements are also a high priority; many users have expressed that the original Synergy is unsafe, and should be enhanced with use of SSL (issue 3).

== Milestone M3 ==

Our aim here is to integrate an existing GUI with Synergy+ so that we have a common GUI for all platforms (instead of just one for Windows). We're hoping that the QSynergy authors will contribute directly to our repository, and we plan to have a specially modified version of QSynergy that is very closely integrated with Synergy+.

== Milestone M4 ==

This is a new one. Anything that's lower priority than M3 will go here; but we're talking a long time before we get to this point, so nothing is set in stone.
