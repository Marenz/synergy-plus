== Design ==

This section focuses on the existing architecture, code style, and features. Where necessary, improvements on each feature will be suggested.

=== Architecture ===

This section describes the current section. It should be read by developers who wish to plan new features, or improvements to existing features.

_This section is incomplete._

=== Features ===

This section describes both features that already exist (and are to be improved), and features that are to be implemented. Architecture [sub:Architecture] should be consulted before hand.

==== Configuration ====

There currently exists, a user configuration file for synergys which controls the screen layout. However, there should be a configuration file for the application it's self. This will be useful for implementing new features in a phased approach. While the feature is in alpha it will be disabled by default (but can be enabled by the user), and when in beta, it may be enabled during installation.

==== User config path ====

Currently, the user configuration file for windows is synergy.sgc (as defined in synergys.cpp). On Windows Vista and onward, the home directory is now browsable by the user. Windows users generally prefer that configuration files are not stored in this directory, but stored in a hidden place (such as the AppData). However, because some users may prefer this, the user should have the option to choose during setup. The Unix configuration file name and path should be left how it is (.synergy.conf) but possibly drop the .conf extension, because this is generally preferred by *nix users, and files preceding with a period are hidden by default. This is a low priority improvement.
