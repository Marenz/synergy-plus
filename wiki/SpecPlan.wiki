#summary Specification plan and guide to writing new pages.
#labels Specification

  * Each major section (Introduction, Design, etc.) is designated to one page.
  * If a section becomes longer than approx 5 screens full, it should be split in to two pages.
  * Specification page names must start with Spec, and must be short (e.g. SpecIntro).
  * The specification should be written from the "we" and not the "I" perspective.
  * Each page should link back to the specification table of contents.
