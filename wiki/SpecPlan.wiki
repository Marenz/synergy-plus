#summary Specification: Plan
#labels Specification

A specification plan and guide to writing new specification pages.

  * Each major section (Introduction, Design, etc.) is designated to one page.
  * If a section becomes longer than approx 5 screens full, it should be split in to two pages.
  * Specification page names must start with Spec, and must be short (e.g. SpecIntro).
  * Each page should start with "Synergy+ Specification" (style: Heading 1)
  * The page summary should be in the format "Specification: {Title}"
  * The specification should be written from the 'we' and not the 'I' perspective.
  * Each page should link back to the specification table of contents.
