#summary Specification: Plan & Guide
#labels Specification

A specification plan and guide to writing new specification pages.

== Guidelines ==

  * Each major section (Introduction, Design, etc.) is designated to one page.
  * If a section becomes longer than approx 5 screens full, it should be split in to two pages.
  * Specification page names must start with Spec, and must be short (e.g. SpecIntro).
  * Each page should start with "Synergy+ Specification" (style: Heading 1)
  * The page summary should be in the format "Specification: {Title}"
  * The specification should be written from the 'we' and not the 'I' perspective.
  * Each page should link back to the specification table of contents.

== TODO List ==

  * The specification looks good in document form, but on a wiki it seems to be a little more chaotic than anticipated. It's hard to distinguish some header types from others:
    * Solution 1: Manually number the headings (con: hard to maintain).
    * Solution 2: Split the pages up even further (con: long winded).

== Diagrams ==

For creating diagrams:

  * Linux: Dia
  * Windows: Visio

Both Dia and Visio are quite similar, but Dia is a little more robust.

The .dia file or .visio file should be saved in the source control, so that others may edit it should the original author be hit by a bus.

To publish, the file should be exported to JPEG and added to the Wiki under the relevant specification page (usually SpecDesign).
