= Creating Issues =

If you discover an issue in Synergy+, please report it through our [http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/issues/list issue tracker]. Issues can be bug reports or feature requests. Please refrain from having lengthy discussions in the issue tracker, and instead [http://groups.google.com/group/synergy-plus/post create a new thread in the mailing list] as this will make it easier community members to contribute, making it more likely for the issue to be resolved effectively. Once creating a new mailing list thread, make sure the issue number is referenced.

= Moderating Issues =

These are guidelines for members who moderate issues.

== Accepting ==

Consider the following, or some variant:

  Thanks for submitting a new issue. I have marked the issue as accepted, and we will keep you informed of it's progress.

Then set the status to `Accepted`, and choose a milestone. Ensure that feature requests are marked as `Enhancement`, not `Defect`. It's OK to say you'll keep them informed, because the system will do this for them automatically when updates are added.

== Rejecting ==

Users will sometimes have a feature request, which may be outside the scope of our specification. In this case, we should politely tell the user that the feature will not be implemented.

  Thanks for the feature request. Unfortunately, the feature you requested is outside the scope of our specification. Please feel free to suggest other ideas.

Then set the status to `WontFix` (and *not* `Invalid`). Only set an issue to `invalid` if it's garbage or has empty text.

== Duplicates ==

New users don't have the experience we have. Therefore, its not their fault if they submit a duplicate bug report. This situation should be met with a polite message.

  Thanks for submitting a new issue. Would you mind starring issue {issue-id}? It looks like the same problem.

*Note:* {issue-id} is a number.

Then set the status to duplicate. If the user is adamant that the issue is not a duplicate, then give them the benefit of the doubt.
