Check the [http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/downloads/list Downloads] page to see if there's a tar.gz available.

For example:

{{{
wget http://synergy-plus.googlecode.com/files/synergy-plus-1.3.4.tar.gz
tar xfvz synergy-plus-1.3.4.tar.gz
}}}

*Important!* If you download the source code for 1.3.4, then please follow the [http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/wiki/CompilingAutomake Automake compile instructions]. However, if you're contributing to our project, we advise that you download the latest version via our Mercurial repository (option 2).
