#summary Automated regression tests with result set to mailing list
#labels Deprecated

We should create a (or use an existing) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing regression test] suite to run a scheduled weekly regression test on the Synergy+ code base from the repository.

The result should be sent to a specific mailing list (e.g. synergy-plus-tests) to which any community member can subscribe.
