#summary Details about supported operating systems
#labels Phase-Requirements

== Fully Supported ==

  * Windows XP SP3
  * Windows 2003 Server
  * Windows Vista SP1
  * Windows 7

These are supported without releasing binary builds (such as packages). We intend to introduce an easy to install method for all of these operating systems once the first milestone has passed (bug fixes).

  * Mac OS 10.4 Tiger
  * Mac OS 10.5 Leopard
  * Mac OS 10.6 Snow-Leopard
  * openSUSE
  * Ubuntu
  * Fedora

== Unsupported Operating Systems ==

Synergy+ may work on these platforms, as it was originally designed for them. However we will not fix bugs or introduce features that specifically support these platforms.

  * Windows NT family (e.g. 2000, etc)
  * Windows 95 family (e.g. 98/ME)
