== Q: Why do I get "HTTP Error 405: Method Not Allowed" when using hg push? ==

Use https instead of http.

== Q: How do I submit patches? ==

Use `hg export`, to export your changes. Rumor is that these are then easily applied using patch(1), so, .patch files are welcome!

Submit patches to the [http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/issues/list issue list] as an attachment. If an issue does not exist for your patch, please [http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/issues/entry create a new issue]. If you submit to the mailing list, it may get missed. When you submit your patch, if you want it to be discussed, please open a new mailing list thread and link to the issue containing the patch.

== Q: What is the `ARCH` macro for? ==

The `ARCH` macro is defined in `lib/arch/CArch.h` and accesses a static singleton pointer for the _architecture_ tools.

For example, ARCH->addrToString(CArchNetAddress) will convert an address instance to an IP address as type std::string.

To use the ARCH macro, `#include "CArch.h"`
