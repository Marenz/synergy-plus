= Questions =

== Q. I'm new, how do I get started? ==

First, you'll need to get your hands on the [SourceCode source code], and then you can [Compiling compile] it. If you're having any problems, then please [Contact contact us].

== Q. How do I start synergys and synergyc directly with Visual Studio? ==

Right click either the synergys or synergyc projects, and select Properties. Click Debugging, and add the following to the Command Arguments textbox:

*for synergys:*
{{{
--no-daemon --debug DEBUG1 --name my-computer-1 --address :24800
}}}
Replace 'my-computer-1' with your computer name.

*for synergyc:*
{{{
--no-daemon --debug DEBUG1 my-computer-1
}}}
Replace 'my-computer-1' with your server's hostname.

== Q. How do I install the Windows service with a non-default bugging level? ==

From the Windows config GUI, select the debug level (on the main screen) before installing the service. This stores the command line arguments in the Windows registry - to change the debug level after service is installed, uninstall the service, select new log level and reinstall service.

== Q. What is your C++ code style guide? ==

This can be found in our [TheBible#4.2._Code_style specification].

== Q. Why do I get an XTest error when compiling on Ubuntu? ==

Ensure that the libXtst-dev or libXtst-devel package is installed.

== Q. How do I submit patches? ==

Simply run `svn diff > foobar.patch` and submit by attaching to a [http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/issues/entry new] or [http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/issues/list existing] issue.

Once you submit your patch, our [Members patch manager] will review and apply the patch, then commit to the repository.

== Q. How do I make emacs use your indentation style? ==

You could add this to the end of your `.emacs` file.
{{{
; Visual Studio like indentation
(defun my-c-mode-common-hook ()
	;; my customizations for all of c-mode, c++-mode, objc-mode, java-mode
	(c-set-offset 'substatement-open 0)
	;; other customizations can go here

	(setq c++-tab-always-indent t)
	(setq c-basic-offset 4)                  ;; Default is 2
	(setq c-indent-level 4)                  ;; Default is 2

	(setq tab-stop-list '(4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60))
	(setq tab-width 4)
	(setq indent-tabs-mode t)  ; use spaces only if nil
)
(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'my-c-mode-common-hook)
}}}
This will make your indentation style similar to that in Visual Studio.

== Q. How do I make vim use your style guidelines? ==

There is a [http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/source/browse/trunk/.lvimrc .lvimrc] included in Trunk. To use it install [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=441 Vim script 411]

== Q. What is the `ARCH` macro for? ==

The `ARCH` macro is defined in `lib/arch/CArch.h` and accesses a static singleton pointer for the _architecture_ tools.

For example, ARCH->addrToString(CArchNetAddress) will convert an address instance to an IP address as type std::string.

To use the ARCH macro, `#include "CArch.h"`
