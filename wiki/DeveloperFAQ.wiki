*Q: Why do I get "HTTP Error 405: Method Not Allowed" when using hg push?*

Use https instead of http.

----

*Q: How do I submit patches?*

If you don't yet have commit access, then `hg export` your changes, and then post them as [http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/issues/entry an issue], or the [http://groups.google.com/group/synergy-plus discussion group]. Rumor is that these are then easily applied using patch(1), so, .patch files are welcome!

*Q: What is the `ARCH` macro for?*

The `ARCH` macro is defined in `lib/arch/CArch.h` and accesses a static singleton pointer for the _architecture_ tools.

For example, ARCH->addrToString(CArchNetAddress) will convert an address instance to an IP address as type std::string.

To use the ARCH macro, `#include "CArch.h"`
